This profound question left me momentarily silenced. The word "cure" implies something **wrong** that needs to be removed or fixed, but trauma is different. Trauma is not something someone **chooses** to experience; it is something that happens to them. 

In his book, _[The Body Keeps the Score](https://amzn.to/3FgG4Uz)_, Bessel van der Kolk says, *“nobody can ‘treat’ a war, or abuse, rape, molestation... what has happened cannot be undone.”* Trauma becomes embedded in our system, often as a means of **protection** against future threats.

## What is Trauma?

Our **bodies are smart**. They remember past experiences, both pleasurable and harmful, in order to protect us. Sometimes this memory is so strong that it’s triggered even in non-threatening situations. Trauma is the result of exposure to actual or threatened **death**, serious injury, or **violence**. This might be experienced directly, witnessed, or heard about from someone close.

Common trauma symptoms include **flashbacks**, nightmares, feelings of isolation, and **persistent negative emotions**. When these symptoms become severe, they can lead to a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

The good news is that **trauma research** has provided many effective ways to reduce or eliminate its effects.

## What Can I Do if I Have Experienced Trauma?

Depending on the severity of the trauma, there are several approaches you can take to begin the healing process:

### 1. Information and Resources

Fear often stems from a **lack of understanding**. Learning about trauma and its effects can empower you to take control of your recovery. Below are some recommended resources.

### 2. Therapy

Therapy is a highly effective way to address trauma. Consider researching specific trauma-focused therapies, such as:

- [Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)](https://www.emdr.com/what-is-emdr/)
- [Somatic Experiencing](https://traumahealing.org/se-101/)
- [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/cognitive-behavioral-therapy)
- [Internal Family Systems Therapy](https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/internal-family-systems-therapy)
- [Prolonged Exposure Therapy](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/prolonged-exposure)
- [Group Therapy](https://www.agpa.org/home/practice-resources/evidence-based-practice-in-group-psychotherapy/trauma-ptsd)

### 3. Movement and Art

Van der Kolk emphasizes the healing power of movement and art. Activities like **yoga**, **theater**, **art**, and **dance** can help reconnect you with your body and provide alternative outlets for processing pain.

### 4. Medication

Medication can be another effective form of treatment for PTSD. If you’re interested in exploring this, consult with a primary care physician or psychiatrist.

## Trauma is Not Something to Be "Fixed"

Trauma becomes a part of us and helps shape who we are, but it doesn’t define us. While its symptoms can be reduced or resolved, trauma itself is not something to be removed but rather something to be **acknowledged** and processed with care.
