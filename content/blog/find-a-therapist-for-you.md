So, you’ve decided to [start therapy](https://www.erindtherapy.com/2021/07/15/when-is-it-time-for-therapy/). The next step is finding a therapist who connects with you, understands your experiences, and meets your needs. Much like choosing a physician, dentist, or teacher, you have the **right** to select who you trust with your story. Below are some things to consider as you navigate how to [find the right therapist for you](https://www.erindtherapy.com/contact).

Although finding a therapist may seem daunting, it's worth the effort to find someone who supports you in the ways you need. Feel free to “shop around” by scheduling consultations or intake sessions with a few therapists. Here are some tips to narrow down your search:

- Use therapy directory sites.
- Filter by location, specializations, or therapy type.
- Read therapists’ bios to get a sense of their style.
- Set up a consultation or intake session.

## **Referral Sources**

There are various ways to search for a therapist, but using specialized directory sites is a great start. Whether you’re looking for help with **depression**, **anxiety**, **relationship issues**, or **anger management**, you can narrow your search by focus area and ensure the therapist specializes in your goals. Here are some recommended directories:

- [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)
- [Therapy Den](https://www.therapyden.com/)
- [Good Therapy](https://www.goodtherapy.org/)
- [Open Path Collective: Affordable Therapy](https://openpathcollective.org/)

When reviewing therapists, consider the following:

- Do they seem relatable? Can they support you?
- What **issues** do they specialize in?
- What are their **credentials** and **specialties**?
- Do they accept **in-network** insurance or are they **out-of-network**?
- Do you get a good **vibe** from their profile?

Other sources for referrals include friends, family, doctors, universities, churches, or directly through your **insurance company**. Receiving a referral from someone you trust can make it easier to take that first step toward healing.

## **Filters**

Many therapy directory sites offer filters to help narrow your search based on your specific needs. Some common filters include:

- **Therapy Type**: Individual counseling, [couples counseling](https://www.erindtherapy.com/2021/07/28/why-couples-therapy-is-underrated/), or family therapy.
- **Demographics**: Ethnicity, faith, gender, and sexuality the therapist serves.
- **Languages**: Therapists who speak your language.
- **Insurance**: Whether the therapist is in-network with your insurance provider.

You can also filter by **location** or the **mode of therapy**—whether you prefer **in-person** sessions or [telehealth](https://www.erindtherapy.com/faq/). If you choose in-person, entering your zip code can help find therapists nearby. Telehealth allows for a broader search since therapists can only offer counseling within the states they’re licensed.

## **Consultations**

Many therapists now offer **free 15-30 minute consultations** to determine whether they’re a good fit for you. These consultations are also a great time to ask questions. You might consider asking:

1. What is your **philosophy** or **approach** to therapy?
2. What is your **availability**?
3. Do you accept **insurance**, or are you **private pay**?
4. If private pay, do you offer **Superbills** for potential insurance reimbursement?
5. Any other questions or preferences you have.

## **Are They a Good Fit?**

It’s hard to know if a therapist is a good fit based on their bio, a consultation, or even a few sessions. But as you get to know them, ask yourself: **Do I feel heard or seen by this therapist?** Do they align with my **style**, **demeanor**, and **approach**? Can they help me based on their **experience** and **specialization**?

Remember, building rapport in therapy takes time, and it’s normal to take a while to feel comfortable opening up.

## **What if the Fit Doesn’t Feel Right?**

If you find that you’re not connecting with your therapist, you always have the right to **pause or stop therapy**. You can also express your feelings of disconnect with your therapist. This can open the door for adjusting your treatment plan, giving feedback, or even getting referrals to another therapist who might be a better fit.

Therapy is a journey, and part of that journey is advocating for your needs and ensuring you’re getting the support you deserve.
