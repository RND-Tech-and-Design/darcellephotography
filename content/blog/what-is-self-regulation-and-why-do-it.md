Self-regulation means finding ways to get your body to a **comfortable and balanced place**. It's about helping your body feel safe and satisfied, whether through meeting basic needs like eating, drinking, and sleeping, or regulating emotions such as anxiety and depression.

## The Nervous System and Self-Regulation

The nervous system plays a huge role in both our **physical and emotional experiences**. It affects everything from our mood and heart rate to our digestion and immune system [1]. Learning how to regulate the nervous system can **boost your mood, improve immune responses**, and generally improve your quality of life.

## How Can I Self-Regulate?

1. **Breathe.**  
   When anxious or scared, our breathing often changes—either by holding our breath or hyperventilating. **Deep breathing** ensures we get the oxygen our brain needs to make responsive decisions instead of reactive ones.

2. **Yoga.**  
   Certain poses, such as child’s pose or tree pose, help calm the nerves and tie breath to movement. Yoga helps us feel more **in control of our bodies**, especially when we feel overwhelmed.

3. **Mindfulness and Meditation.**  
   These practices have been shown to **reduce stress, anxiety, and depression**. Explore various types of meditation to find one that suits you [2].

4. **Connect with Others.**  
   According to Dr. Perry and Oprah Winfrey in *[What Happened to You?](https://amzn.to/3OP8Q1v)*, positive interactions—whether through work, worship, or fun—help us feel more regulated. **Relational regulation** also reduces reliance on unhealthy coping mechanisms such as overeating or substance use [3].

## What Are Some Ways to Reduce Anxiety?

- **Acknowledge It.**  
   Recognize and **name your anxiety**. Denying its presence may worsen it. Acknowledging your anxiety helps give it the attention it needs.

- **Practice Breathing Techniques.**  
   Use breathing exercises **before** you become dysregulated. This helps prevent heightened anxiety, allowing you to **respond** rather than react.

- **Gather Information.**  
   Anxiety often stems from the unknown. Gathering more information about what’s causing your anxiety can help reduce it.
