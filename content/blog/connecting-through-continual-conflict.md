We cannot move past an argument or even begin solving our issues until **all sides have felt heard**. Often, we enter a conflict ready to persuade the other person that **we are right**. But in reality, both perspectives can be **valid**. Acknowledging this is the first step toward moving forward and connecting.

## Common Causes of Recurring Conflict

Recurring arguments often happen because neither party feels truly heard. It’s frustrating to share your side only to be **dismissed** or **ignored**. Before moving forward, both parties must **meet each other where they are**.

## Ground Rules for Difficult Conversations

Consider these points before entering a recurring argument:

1. **Clarify the conversation’s purpose.** Are you trying to persuade the other person or genuinely understand their perspective? The former will likely lead to another unresolved conversation.
2. **Ensure both parties are calm** and ready to engage. If not, take a break and revisit the conversation later.
3. **Enter with curiosity** and an open mind. This allows for deeper understanding and might reveal details you didn’t know.
4. **Take turns** speaking and listening.
5. **Address escalation** with statements like, “I’m feeling upset, can we take a break?” or “I’m not feeling understood, here’s what I need you to know.”

## Role of the Speaker

The speaker’s responsibility is to approach the conversation **kindly** and describe events **objectively**. It’s helpful to use **“I” statements** instead of “you” statements:

- **“I felt hurt when you said…”**
- **“I saw you do…”**
- **“I heard you say…”**

Focusing on feelings about the situation helps shift the conversation.

## Role of the Listener

The listener must focus on **clarifying** the other person’s experience without defensiveness. Ask **open-ended** questions like:

- “What was that like for you?”
- “What did you mean when you said…?”

Once the speaker feels **fully heard**, only then can the listener become the speaker.

## Does This Really Work?

Yes, this method can work. It’s based on the research of Anatol Rapoport, a conflict resolution expert. His work, along with approaches like the [Gottman Method](https://www.gottman.com/about/the-gottman-method/), shows that conflict management is possible when both parties feel understood. I've seen this approach succeed in therapy sessions when ground rules are established and practiced consistently.
