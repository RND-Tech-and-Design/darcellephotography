## Recharge the Relationship

Did you know that on average, it takes couples about **6 years** to attend therapy after first considering it [1]? Often, by that time, therapy could have been beneficial earlier. Like yearly wellness exams, relationships can benefit from regular check-ups too.

A lot can happen in a year, so setting aside time to **recharge your relationship** through therapy, workshops, or self-led check-ins can make a significant difference. Just like your computer requires regular updates, your relationship can benefit from **consistent care** and communication updates.

## Why Couples Therapy?

We sometimes fall into **communication patterns** that are no longer effective. Work, family, and daily life can push our personal needs to the side. But with a strong connection to our partner, life's stressors become more manageable. Here are some reasons why couples therapy can be beneficial:

- Strengthen or **rekindle your connection**.
- Review **communication patterns**.
- Learn tools to manage conflict more effectively.
- Address **past unresolved conflicts**.
- Explore **intimacy needs** and differences.
- Discuss **parenting challenges**.

## What's the Delay?

Sometimes, one partner may be more open to therapy than the other, which is natural. Some fear that therapy might indicate an impending **divorce**, but it often does the opposite. Therapy can **deepen connections** and clarify relationship goals. For others, it may be a way to respectfully and healthily explore **ending a relationship**.

If these thoughts resonate with you, therapy could be the solution to **address** your concerns.
