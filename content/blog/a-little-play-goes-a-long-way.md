## What is Play?

Play is an activity many adults lose touch with. It’s unique because its sole purpose is just to play — not to achieve a specific goal. Play is a way for children (and adults) to **express themselves without judgment**, offering a rare break from the constant feedback we receive from the world. 

When is the last time you played **just to play**?

## How to Play

It’s easy to get caught up in daily pressures, making it difficult to connect with loved ones. But **play** is a powerful way to bond, especially with children. It doesn’t have to be complex: a simple game of tag, board games, arts and crafts, or hide and seek can create a connection. Let your child lead — it shows them you value their ideas.

## What Does Play Do?

Play provides a safe space for children to **explore, problem-solve, and be creative**. It's also one of the few areas where children get to take charge. While routines and schedules are good for kids, play allows them to **lead on their terms**, which is rare in their structured lives. 

By setting aside even 15 minutes of undivided attention for play (no phones, TV, or other distractions), you send an important message: "I see you, I value you, and I enjoy spending time with you." This helps build a foundation of **trust, safety, and love** that’s essential for their future relationships.

Next time you’re wondering what to do, **choose play**.
