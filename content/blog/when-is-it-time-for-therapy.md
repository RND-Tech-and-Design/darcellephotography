The short answer: **anytime**. It is never too soon, never too late, and never not okay to attend therapy. But it can be hard to figure out when to prioritize the time, energy, and resources for it. Whether it's daunting to find a therapist or you’re unsure if it’s the right time, this post will help you decide if therapy might be a good option for you.

## What Even is Therapy?

Therapy is a space where **all parts of you are welcome**. It’s a place to explore your needs, even discovering them for the first time. Therapy is different for everyone because we all have unique experiences and reasons for attending.

## Why Attend?

There are many reasons people consider therapy. These can include, but are not limited to:

- Grief
- Trauma (past or recent)
- Relationship mediation
- Couples or family counseling
- Boundary-setting
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Suicidal ideation
- Disordered eating
- Phobias
- Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
- Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD/ADD)
- Insomnia

However, therapy is not limited to these issues. It can also be a space for **problem-solving, gaining outside perspectives, expressing feelings**, and, most importantly, a place to simply **be**. Therapy offers a unique opportunity to be seen and held by someone unconditionally.
