It is not uncommon to become [emotionally flooded](https://www.erindtherapy.com/2022/07/21/feeling-flooded/) during conflict with a partner. Without steps to respond to it, emotional injuries can occur. Developing a ritual with your partner around flooding can provide a reliable way to navigate these challenging moments.

## Develop a Ritual

Consider the following steps to plan with your partner while both of you are calm and not in conflict:

1. **Provide a stop signal**: Discuss a stop signal when you're in a neutral or positive state. Avoid bringing this up during conflict.
2. **Stop all interaction** when the signal is given. Even if one partner wants to continue, it's best to halt the conversation to avoid further emotional damage.
3. **Separate for 20-30 minutes** to self-soothe. Establish a check-in time—whether in 30 minutes, 2 hours, or at dinner. This ensures both partners understand the conversation will continue, and it validates feelings that need revisiting.
4. **Practice self-soothing**: Engage in activities that effectively distract you and help you return to a calm state. This might include:
   - [Meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZToicYcHIOU)
   - [Progressive muscle relaxation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOhGBaiA4CU)
   - [Body scans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zX-QbXIT4)
   - Walking, running, reading, or playing a game.
5. **Re-engage and repair**: If the conversation is not revisited, unresolved issues may build up over time. Re-engage with statements like “I’m sorry I got upset. Are you ready to talk?” or “I’m feeling calmer and ready to discuss. How about you?”

If neither of you are ready, set a new time to check back in. This communication reinforces the importance of the issue, acknowledges the need for space, and paves the way for a healthier discussion later.

## Returning to the Conversation

Naming emotional flooding is crucial, but so is [processing conflict](https://www.gottman.com/blog/manage-conflict-the-aftermath-of-a-fight/) or finding a resolution. Leaving an argument without clarity can lead to long-term resentment. Consider [couples therapy](https://www.erindtherapy.com/couples-therapy/) to process past fights or carefully create a ritual that ensures both partners feel cared for, even when emotions run high.
